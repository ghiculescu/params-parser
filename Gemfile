# If you use Rails 7a7b5baea6851e1a0c65492d85bba419ec160e16 and Rack 2.2.9, you get "amp"=>nil, "user_id"=>"123"
# Any other combinations, you get "amp;user_id"=>"123"
# So the specific issue is that something (possibly https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53193) broke compatability with Rack 2.x for this specific use case.
